  "overview": "Traveling through Mongol Altai mountains - the country’s largest and highest mountain range with glacier topped peaks over 3000 meters, crystal clear mountain rivers, and glistening streams were to inhabit the world’s largest wild sheep - argali, ibex, snow leopard, wolves, eagles, and many other bird species. Then heading to Ulgii town, enjoy Golden Eagle Festival, experience ancient eagle hunting tradition and Kazakh culture. \n\nThe name Altai Tavan Bogd (Five Holy Peaks of  Altai) was given to a  cluster of 5 dramatic peaks that tower this extensive Mongol Altai mountain range. The climate is extreme with very little vegetation, giving the surrounding landscape a barren appearance. Trekking session leads us to the holy 5 peaks where the highest is Khuiten peak at 4374m. We trek through the snowy mountains, cross the longest glaciers of the country.\nThe official opening ceremony begins with a parade of the hunters on horseback with their eagles. The most elaborate clothing and accessories are rewarded with the highest points. Later in the day, the eagles are judged for their speed and agility. The second day of the competition is packed with action-eagles fly from the cliff’s edge to chase bait dragged by their human hunting partners, and the men demonstrate their courage in an ancient test of horsemanship.",

All teaching and instruction have been given orally, passed from shaman to shaman over the centuries, and its traditions learned by heart. Mongolian shamans enter an ecstatic trance state in which the shaman is empowered to engage with the spirits I order to protect and heal members of the community, to guide souls, and cure illnesses.\n\nThe shaman might wear a headdress to resemble a bird, with the tail of a pheasant and the body costume of a fish. Drums are used to help the shaman enter the trance-like state, as chanting begins and the shaman “transcends “into another world while the body dances, swirls, or totters with jerky movements. Shamanism went underground during the former communist period but has been revived recently.",

Excursion through the monastery, located at the foot of Burenkhaan mountain, Amarbayasgalant or \"Monastery of Tranquil Felicity”, is one of the largest and most important monasteries in Mongolia. Built between 1727 and 1736 with more than 40 temples in honor of Zanabazar, the first Bogd Gegeen (Spiritual leader of Mongolian Buddhism), it is one of the very few monasteries to have partly escaped the destruction of 1937, after which only the buildings of the central section remained. The entire contents: the Tankas, statues, and manuscripts were looted by the Communists or hidden until more fortunate times. Restoration work began in 1988 and now the Amarbayasgalant monastery shows great stylistic unity. (B/L/D)",

Certainly, the best place to experience it is in the countryside where the nomadic herders have lived in much the same way for a hundred years. The hard conditions of life, far from embittering them, gave rise to the long-standing traditions of friendliness and hospitality.\n\nThis is a very unique cultural exchange program for those who wish to live a real nomadic life, becoming a part of the herders family - it’s certainly an experience of a lifetime, the chance that never comes again. Just practice that how can human life be so free a common being away from noisy city streets and high- tech boom!",

  "overview": "​Explore Kharkhorin, the formerly great capital city of the Mongol Empire, which was built by Ugudei Khaan in 1235. The city was strategically located at the crossroads of traditional routes, creating a staging post for migrating nomads and merchants caravans. Foreign envoys and prominent clerics traveled to this city for an audience with Mongol khan.\nFar after when the Hubilai Khaan moved t the capital to Beijing in 1264, Kharkhorin was raised to the ground by Manchu soldiers. However the bricks and stones from the ruins of this ancient city were used to build the Erdene Zuu Monastery nearby, so in that way, the old city lives on till today.\n\nErdene Zuu Monastery: The first Buddhist monastery in Mongolia, Erdene Zuu was established on the ruin of ancient Kharkhorin city in 1586 by Avtai Sain khan, probably the most ancient surviving Buddhist monastery in Mongolia. The monastery located in Kharkhorin sum, Uvurkhangai province. It is surrounded by a fortress wall-sized 420m on each side, with 108 stupas. In 1792, it housed 62 temples, Mongolian lords tried to have their own named temple inside of the wall of the monastery because it means they have a high reputation. Also in 1658, the biggest ger consists of 35 walls, 1700 long pole and could contain 200 people, was built up at the middle space of the monastery wall.\n\nThree main temples are named west zuu, middle zuu, and east zuu. Zuu means the respectful name of Buddha. So we can see Buddha’s different images such as past time Buddha, future time Buddha, present time Buddha, his child image, adult image, old aged image, and his sapient pupils in these temples. These temples have double-wall, to encapsulate warmth and cool and kind of praying named “Goroo”. Today this monastery could become an active monastery again and open for local believers and visitors. This is one of the places where we can learn more about the religious and cultural traditions of Mongolia. ",

  "overview": "In this trip, you will travel in Mongolia’s large number of lakes and rivers, and its sparse population, which generally prefers meat, the fish are just waiting to be caught. There are more than 70 species of fish in Mongolia such as taimen, grayling, lennock, sturgeon, pike, and perch. The fishing can be practiced anywhere: Khagiin Khar lake, the three nearby rivers, Orkhon river, and lake Ugii are noted for the lucky trophies. Fly-fishing in Mongolia is unique. While the native taimen, which can top five feet in length, has become the ultimate sport fisherman’s catch, many prefer the action and the thrills of fishing for acrobatic grayling and lennock in Mongolia’s rivers.",
