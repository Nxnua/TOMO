        "overview": "Imagine that after finding yourself in the very heart of the Gobi Desert you will be at the beautiful Baikal Lake surrounded by deep alpine forest just in 15 days. To do this way you have to cross the border of two big countries much different from each other: Mongolia and Russia. Our tour starts from Mongolia - a land of nomadic civilization under the cloudless blue sky, and the boundless steppe with freely galloping horsemen. Trip to South Gobi desert will give you real adventure by slipping down from the top of awesome sand dunes, riding Bactrian camels, visiting burial place of dinosaurs. Further our trip turns up to the Kharkhorin - the ruins of ancient Mongolian capital with historical Erdene Zuu Monastery aside. Beautiful lake Ogii, place of tranquility, lies on your way to have a good relaxation after long way driving through the legendary land.\n\nAfter crossing Mongolia-Russian borders, we arrive in Ulan-Ude, capital of Buryata, where we start our touring around magnificent Baikal Lake. One of interesting sites of our tour is Ivolginsky Datsan - the center of Buddhism of Russia in 30 km far from Ulan-Ude City. Our next stopover point is Irkutsk - one of the oldest and most attractive Siberian cities with the largest transport unit on the Transsiberian railroad. Enjoy the magnificent views of Baikal Lake from the highest spot in the area - Tchersky Peak and boating in the largest and the deepest lake in the world.",
