                                Mongolia for 9 days as incredible. Nurka proved
                                to be a well organised, trusted and a dedicated
                                guide. She speaks very good English and talks
                                with enthusiasm about Mongolia, food, cultured
                                its history as well as providing insight into
                                Mongolia customs. We enjoyed tea parties, games
                                and also got to mix with the locals who were
                                friendly and kind people who showed us their
                                herds and how to make traditional cake. Part of
                                the activities was hiking for 5 days where she
                                led us into touristic sites and wonderful
                                sceneries surrounded by beautiful lakes and
                                panorama views, which thoroughly enjoyed and
                                took many photos!. She was knowledgeable about
                                all the routes we took provided us with a packed
                                and varied programmes, helped organise our yaks
                                and the tents were well equipped with good gear
                                to keep us dry during rainy days. it was an
                                amazing and unforgettable experience! She also
                                had an incredible team who supported her all
                                along including skilful drivers who drove us
                                through unmarked roads in such a vast place, and
                                Boogy the cook, who was enthusiastic and
                                passionate about his cooking sckill he made us
                                delicious food that we enjoyed. All in all I

                                we felt safe and welcome.Our happiness was
